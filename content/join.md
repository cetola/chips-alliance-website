The CHIPS Alliance is an organization which works collaboratively to develop high quality, open source hardware designs relevant to silicon devices and FPGAs. By sharing openly resources and ideas, we hope to lower the cost of hardware development.

As a collection of open source projects, anyone is welcome to participate in the technical development process. The Technical Advisory Council oversees the technical direction of the project.

The CHIPS Alliance also welcomes corporate members. By participating as a corporate member, your organization provides vital funding for the infrastructure and activities that support our open and collaborative development process.
